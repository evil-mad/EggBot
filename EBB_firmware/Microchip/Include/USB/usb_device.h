    various USB commands as well as take action when required for various events
    that occur on the bus.

Description:
    This file, with its associated C source file, provides the main substance of
    the USB device side stack.  These files will receive, transmit, and process
    various USB commands as well as take action when required for various events
    that occur on the bus.

    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include

    .
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

  Function:
        void USBDeviceTasks(void)
    
  Summary:
    This function is the main state machine/transaction handler of the USB 
    device side stack.  When the USB stack is operated in "USB_POLLING" mode 
    (usb_config.h user option) the USBDeviceTasks() function should be called 
    periodically to receive and transmit packets through the stack. This 
    function also takes care of control transfers associated with the USB 
    enumeration process, and detecting various USB events (such as suspend).  
    This function should be called at least once every 1.8ms during the USB 
    enumeration process. After the enumeration process is complete (which can 
    be determined when USBGetDeviceState() returns CONFIGURED_STATE), the 
    USBDeviceTasks() handler may be called the faster of: either once 
    every 9.8ms, or as often as needed to make sure that the hardware USTAT 
    FIFO never gets full.  A good rule of thumb is to call USBDeviceTasks() at
    a minimum rate of either the frequency that USBTransferOnePacket() gets 
    called, or, once/1.8ms, whichever is faster.  See the inline code comments 
    near the top of usb_device.c for more details about minimum timing 
    requirements when calling USBDeviceTasks().
    
    When the USB stack is operated in "USB_INTERRUPT" mode, it is not necessary
    to call USBDeviceTasks() from the main loop context.  In the USB_INTERRUPT
    mode, the USBDeviceTasks() handler only needs to execute when a USB 
    interrupt occurs, and therefore only needs to be called from the interrupt 
    context.

    context.

    Typical usage:
    <code>
    void main(void)
    {
        USBDeviceInit();
        while(1)
        {
            USBDeviceTasks(); //Takes care of enumeration and other USB events
            if((USBGetDeviceState() \< CONFIGURED_STATE) ||
               (USBIsDeviceSuspended() == TRUE))
            {
                //Either the device is not configured or we are suspended,
                // so we don't want to execute any USB related application code
                continue;   //go back to the top of the while loop
            }
            else
            {
                //Otherwise we are free to run USB and non-USB related user 
                //application code.
                UserApplication();
            }
        }
    }
    </code>

  Precondition:
    Make sure the USBDeviceInit() function has been called prior to calling
    USBDeviceTasks() for the first time.
  Remarks:
    USBDeviceTasks() does not need to be called while in the USB suspend mode, 
    if the user application firmware in the USBCBSuspend() callback function
    enables the ACTVIF USB interrupt source and put the microcontroller into 
    sleep mode.  If the application firmware decides not to sleep the 
    microcontroller core during USB suspend (ex: continues running at full 
    frequency, or clock switches to a lower frequency), then the USBDeviceTasks()
    function must still be called periodically, at a rate frequent enough to 
    ensure the 10ms resume recovery interval USB specification is met.  Assuming
    a worst case primary oscillator and PLL start up time of <5ms, then 
    USBDeviceTasks() should be called once every 5ms in this scenario.
   
    When the USB cable is detached, or the USB host is not actively powering 
    the VBUS line to +5V nominal, the application firmware does not always have 
    to call USBDeviceTasks() frequently, as no USB activity will be taking 
    place.  However, if USBDeviceTasks() is not called regularly, some 
    alternative means of promptly detecting when VBUS is powered (indicating 
    host attachment), or not powered (host powered down or USB cable unplugged)
    is still needed.  For self or dual self/bus powered USB applications, see 
    the USBDeviceAttach() and USBDeviceDetach() API documentation for additional 
    considerations.

    In the above example endpoint number MSD_DATA_IN_EP is being configured

  Conditions:

/*************************************************************************
  Function:
    USB_HANDLE USBTransferOnePacket(BYTE ep, BYTE dir, BYTE* data, BYTE len)
    
  Summary:
    Transfers a single packet (one transaction) of data on the USB bus.

  Description:
    The USBTransferOnePacket() function prepares a USB endpoint
    so that it may send data to the host (an IN transaction), or 
    receive data from the host (an OUT transaction).  The 
    USBTransferOnePacket() function can be used both to receive	and 
    send data to the host.  This function is the primary API function 
    provided by the USB stack firmware for sending or receiving application 
    data over the USB port.  

    The USBTransferOnePacket() is intended for use with all application 
    endpoints.  It is not used for sending or receiving applicaiton data 
    through endpoint 0 by using control transfers.  Separate API 
    functions, such as USBEP0Receive(), USBEP0SendRAMPtr(), and
    USBEP0SendROMPtr() are provided for this purpose.

    The	USBTransferOnePacket() writes to the Buffer Descriptor Table (BDT)
    entry associated with an endpoint buffer, and sets the UOWN bit, which 
    prepares the USB hardware to allow the transaction to complete.  The 
    application firmware can use the USBHandleBusy() macro to check the 
    status of the transaction, to see if the data has been successfully 
    transmitted yet.


    Typical Usage
    <code>
    //make sure that the we are in the configured state
    if(USBGetDeviceState() == CONFIGURED_STATE)
    {
        //make sure that the last transaction isn't busy by checking the handle
        if(!USBHandleBusy(USBInHandle))
        {
	        //Write the new data that we wish to send to the host to the INPacket[] array
	        INPacket[0] = USEFUL_APPLICATION_VALUE1;
	        INPacket[1] = USEFUL_APPLICATION_VALUE2;
	        //INPacket[2] = ... (fill in the rest of the packet data)
	      
            //Send the data contained in the INPacket[] array through endpoint "EP_NUM"
            USBInHandle = USBTransferOnePacket(EP_NUM,IN_TO_HOST,(BYTE*)&INPacket[0],sizeof(INPacket));
        }
    }
    </code>

  Conditions:
    Before calling USBTransferOnePacket(), the following should be true.
    1.  The USB stack has already been initialized (USBDeviceInit() was called).
    2.  A transaction is not already pending on the specified endpoint.  This
        is done by checking the previous request using the USBHandleBusy() 
        macro (see the typical usage example).
    3.  The host has already sent a set configuration request and the 
        enumeration process is complete.
        This can be checked by verifying that the USBGetDeviceState() 
        macro returns "CONFIGURED_STATE", prior to calling 
        USBTransferOnePacket().
 					
  Input:
    BYTE ep - The endpoint number that the data will be transmitted or 
	          received on
    BYTE dir - The direction of the transfer
               This value is either OUT_FROM_HOST or IN_TO_HOST
    BYTE* data - For IN transactions: pointer to the RAM buffer containing 
                 the data to be sent to the host.  For OUT transactions: pointer
                 to the RAM buffer that the received data should get written to.
   BYTE len - Length of the data needing to be sent (for IN transactions).
              For OUT transactions, the len parameter should normally be set
              to the endpoint size specified in the endpoint descriptor.    

  Return Values:
    USB_HANDLE - handle to the transfer.  The handle is a pointer to 
                 the BDT entry associated with this transaction.  The
                 status of the transaction (ex: if it is complete or still
                 pending) can be checked using the USBHandleBusy() macro
                 and supplying the USB_HANDLE provided by
                 USBTransferOnePacket().

  Remarks:
    If calling the USBTransferOnePacket() function from within the USBCBInitEP()
    callback function, the set configuration is still being processed and the
    USBDeviceState may not be == CONFIGURED_STATE yet.  In this	special case, 
    the USBTransferOnePacket() may still be called, but make sure that the 
    endpoint has been enabled and initialized by the USBEnableEndpoint() 
    function first.

    Summary:
        This function configures the USB module to "soft detach" itself from
        the USB host.
        
    Description:
        This function configures the USB module to perform a "soft detach"
        operation, by disabling the D+ (or D-) ~1.5k pull up resistor, which
        lets the host know the device is present and attached.  This will make
        the host think that the device has been unplugged.  This is potentially
        useful, as it allows the USB device to force the host to re-enumerate
        the device (on the firmware has re-enabled the USB module/pull up, by
        calling USBDeviceAttach(), to "soft re-attach" to the host).
        
    Precondition:
        Should only be called when USB_INTERRUPT is defined.  See remarks
        section if USB_POLLING mode option is being used (usb_config.h option).

        Additionally, this function should only be called from the main() loop 
        context.  Do not call this function from within an interrupt handler, as 
        this function may modify global interrupt enable bits and settings.
        
    Parameters:
        None
     
    Return Values:
        None
        
    Remarks:
        If the application firmware calls USBDeviceDetach(), it is strongly
        recommended that the firmware wait at least >= 80ms before calling
        USBDeviceAttach().  If the firmeware performs a soft detach, and then
        re-attaches too soon (ex: after a few micro seconds for instance), some
        hosts may interpret this as an unexpected "glitch" rather than as a
        physical removal/re-attachment of the USB device.  In this case the host
        may simply ignore the event without re-enumerating the device.  To 
        ensure that the host properly detects and processes the device soft
        detach/re-attach, it is recommended to make sure the device remains 
        detached long enough to mimic a real human controlled USB 
        unplug/re-attach event (ex: after calling USBDeviceDetach(), do not
        call USBDeviceAttach() for at least 80+ms, preferrably longer.
        
        Neither the USBDeviceDetach() or USBDeviceAttach() functions are blocking
        or take long to execute.  It is the application firmware's 
        responsibility for adding the 80+ms delay, when using these API 
        functions.
        
        Note: The Windows plug and play event handler processing is fairly 
        slow, especially in certain versions of Windows, and for certain USB
        device classes.  It has been observed that some device classes need to
        provide even more USB detach dwell interval (before calling 
        USBDeviceAttach()), in order to work correctly after re-enumeration.
        If the USB device is a CDC class device, it is recommended to wait
        at least 1.5 seconds or longer, before soft re-attaching to the host,
        to provide the plug and play event handler enough time to finish 
        processing the removal event, before the re-attach occurs.
        
        If the application is using the USB_POLLING mode option, then the 
        USBDeviceDetach() and USBDeviceAttach() functions are not available.  
        In this mode, the USB stack relies on the "#define USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" 
        and "#define USB_BUS_SENSE" options in the 
        HardwareProfile – [platform name].h file. 

        When using the USB_POLLING mode option, and the 
        "#define USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" definition has been commented out, then 
        the USB stack assumes that it should always enable the USB module at 
        pretty much all times.  Basically, anytime the application firmware 
        calls USBDeviceTasks(), the firmware will automatically enable the USB 
        module.  This mode would typically be selected if the application was 
        designed to be a purely bus powered device.  In this case, the 
        application is powered from the +5V VBUS supply from the USB port, so 
        it is correct and sensible in this type of application to power up and 
        turn on the USB module, at anytime that the microcontroller is 
        powered (which implies the USB cable is attached and the host is also 
        powered).

        In a self powered application, the USB stack is designed with the 
        intention that the user will enable the "#define USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" 
        option in the HardwareProfile – [platform name].h file.  When this 
        option is defined, then the USBDeviceTasks() function will automatically 
        check the I/O pin port value of the designated pin (based on the 
        #define USB_BUS_SENSE option in the HardwareProfile – [platform name].h 
        file), every time the application calls USBDeviceTasks().  If the 
        USBDeviceTasks() function is executed and finds that the pin defined by 
        the #define USB_BUS_SENSE is in a logic low state, then it will 
        automatically disable the USB module and tri-state the D+ and D- pins.  
        If however the USBDeviceTasks() function is executed and finds the pin 
        defined by the #define USB_BUS_SENSE is in a logic high state, then it 
        will automatically enable the USB module, if it has not already been 
        enabled.

    Description:
        This function indicates to the USB host that the USB device has been
        attached to the bus.  This function needs to be called in order for the
        device to start to enumerate on the bus.
                
    Precondition:
        Should only be called when USB_INTERRUPT is defined.  Also, should only 
        be called from the main() loop context.  Do not call USBDeviceAttach()
        from within an interrupt handler, as the USBDeviceAttach() function
        may modify global interrupt enable bits and settings.

        For normal USB devices:
        Make sure that if the module was previously on, that it has been turned off 
        for a long time (ex: 100ms+) before calling this function to re-enable the module.
        If the device turns off the D+ (for full speed) or D- (for low speed) ~1.5k ohm
        pull up resistor, and then turns it back on very quickly, common hosts will sometimes 
        reject this event, since no human could ever unplug and reattach a USB device in a 
        microseconds (or nanoseconds) timescale.  The host could simply treat this as some kind 
        of glitch and ignore the event altogether.

  Function: void USBDeferOUTDataStage(void);
    
  Summary: This function will cause the USB hardware to continuously NAK the
           OUT data packets sent from the host, during the data stage of a
           device to host control transfer.  This allows the firmware more time
           to prepare the RAM buffer that will eventually be used to receive the
           data from the host.  This is also useful, if the firmware wishes to
           receive the OUT data in a different context than what the
           USBDeviceTasks() function executes at.
           
           Calling this function (macro) will assert ownership of the currently
           pending control transfer.  Therefore, the USB stack will not STALL
           when it reaches the data stage of the control transfer, even if the
           firmware has not (yet) called the USBEP0Receive() API function.  
           However, the application firware must still (eventually, once it is 
           ready) call one of the aforementioned API function.
           
           Example Usage:
           
           1.  Host sends a SETUP packet to the device, requesting a host to 
                device control transfer, with data stage (OUT data packets).
           2.  USBDeviceTasks() executes, and then calls the USBCBCheckOtherReq()
                callback event handler.  The USBCBCheckOtherReq() calls the
                application specific/device class specific handler that detects
                the type of control transfer.
           3.  If the firmware needs more time before it wishes to receive the 
                first OUT data packet, or, if the firmware wishes to process the 
                command in a different context, then it may call 
                USBDeferOUTDataStage(), in the context of the 
                USBCBCheckOtherReq() handler function.
           4.  If the firmware called USBDeferOUTDataStage() in step #3 above,
                then the hardware will NAK the OUT data packets sent by the
                host, for the OUT data stage.
           5.  Once the firmware is ready, it should then call USBEP0Receive(), 
                to prepare the USB stack to receive the OUT data from the host,
                and to write it to the user specified buffer.
           6.  The firmware should now call USBCtrlEPAllowDataStage().  This
                will allow the data stage to complete.  Once all OUT data has
                been received, the user callback function (provided by the
                function pointer provided when calling USBEP0Receive()) will
                get called.            
           7.  Once all data has been received from the host, the status stage 
                (a 0-byte IN packet) will complete automatically (assuming the 
                firmware did not call USBDeferStatusStage() during step #3).
            
     
  Description:
    
  Conditions: Before calling USBDeferOUTDataStage(), the firmware should first
                verify that the control transfer has a data stage, and that
                it is of type host-to-device (OUT).

  Input:

  Return:

  Remarks: Section 9.2.6 of the official USB 2.0 specifications indicates that
           the USB device must be able to receive all bytes and complete the
           control transfer within a maximum of 5 seconds.
            
           If the firmware calls USBDeferOUTDataStage(), it must eventually call
           USBEP0Receive(), and then call USBCtrlEPAllowDataStage().  If it does 
           not do this, the control transfer will never be able to complete.
           This will break the USB connection, as the host needs to be able to
           communicate over EP0, in order to perform basic tasks including 
           enumeration. 
           
           The firmware should never call both USBDeferINDataStage() and 
           USBDeferOUTDataStage() during the same control transfer.  These 
           functions are mutually exclusive (a control transfer with data stage
           can never contain both IN and OUT data packets during the data stage).

  Function: void USBDeferStatusStage(void);
    
  Summary: Calling this function will prevent the USB stack from automatically
            enabling the status stage for the currently pending control transfer
            from completing immediately after all data bytes have been sent or 
            received.  This is useful if a class handler or USB application 
            firmware project uses control transfers for sending/receiving data 
            over EP0, but requires time in order to finish processing and/or to 
            consume the data.
            
            For example: Consider an application which receives OUT data from the
            USB host, through EP0 using control transfers.  Now assume that this
            application wishes to do something time consuming with this data (ex:
            transmit it to and save it to an external EEPROM device, connected 
            via SPI/I2C/etc.).  In this case, it would typically be desireable to
            defer allowing the USB status stage of the control transfer to complete,
            until after the data has been fully sent to the EEPROM device and saved.
            
            If the USB class handler firmware that processes the control transfer
            SETUP packet determines that it will need extra time to complete the
            control transfer, it may optionally call USBDeferStatusStage().  If it
            does so, it is then the responsibility of the application firmware to
            eventually call USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage(), once the firmware has
            finished processing the data associated with the control transfer.
            
            If the firmware call USBDeferStatusStage(), but never calls 
            USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage(), then one of two possibilities will occur.
            
            1.  If the "USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS" option is commented in
                usb_config.h, then the status stage of the control transfer will
                never be able to complete.  This is an error case and should be
                avoided.
            2.  If the "USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS" option is enabled in 
                usb_config.h, then the USBDeviceTasks() function will 
                automatically call USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage(), after the 
                "USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT" has elapsed, since the last quanta of
                "progress" has occurred in the control transfer.  Progress is 
                defined as the last successful transaction completing on EP0 IN or
                EP0 OUT.
                Although the timeouts feature allows the status stage to
                [eventually] complete, it is still preferable to manually call 
                USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage() after the application firmware has
                finished processing/consuming the control transfer data, as this
                will allow for much faster processing of control transfers, and
                therefore much higher data rates and better user responsiveness.

  Remarks:  If this function is called, is should get called after the SETUP

            stack.  Therefore, the normal place to call USBDeferStatusStage()

            example, in a HID application using control transfers, the

  Summary: Returns TRUE if a control transfer with OUT data stage is pending,

            not pending, or the firmware did not call USBDeferOUTDataStage()
            at the start of the control transfer.
            
           This function (macro) would typically be used in the case where the

           wishes to take care of handling the data stage of the control transfer
           in the main loop context.  
           
           In this scenario, typical usage would be:
           1.  Host starts a control transfer with OUT data stage.
           2.  USBDeviceTasks() (in this scenario, interrupt context) executes.
           3.  USBDeviceTasks() calls USBCBCheckOtherReq(), which in turn
                determines that the control transfer is class specific, with
                OUT data stage.
           4.  The user code in USBCBCheckOtherReq() (also in interrupt context,
                since it is called from USBDeviceTasks(), and therefore executes

  Function: void USBDeferINDataStage(void);
    
  Summary: This function will cause the USB hardware to continuously NAK the
           IN token packets sent from the host, during the data stage of a
           device to host control transfer.  This allows the firmware more time
           to process and prepare the IN data packets that will eventually be
           sent to the host.  This is also useful, if the firmware needs to
           process/prepare the IN data in a different context than what the
           USBDeviceTasks() function executes at.
           
           Calling this function (macro) will assert ownership of the currently
           pending control transfer.  Therefore, the USB stack will not STALL
           when it reaches the data stage of the control transfer, even if the
           firmware has not (yet) called the USBEP0SendRAMPtr() or 
           USBEP0SendROMPtr() API function.  However, the application firware 
           must still (eventually, once it is ready) call one of the 
           aforementioned API functions.
           
           Example Usage:
           
           1.  Host sends a SETUP packet to the device, requesting a device to 
                host control transfer, with data stage.
           2.  USBDeviceTasks() executes, and then calls the USBCBCheckOtherReq()
                callback event handler.  The USBCBCheckOtherReq() calls the
                application specific/device class specific handler that detects
                the type of control transfer.
           3.  If the firmware needs more time to prepare the first IN data packet,
                or, if the firmware wishes to process the command in a different
                context (ex: if USBDeviceTasks() executes as an interrupt handler,
                but the IN data stage data needs to be prepared in the main loop
                context), then it may call USBDeferINDataStage(), in the context
                of the USBCBCheckOtherReq() handler function.
           4.  If the firmware called USBDeferINDataStage() in step #3 above,
                then the hardware will NAK the IN token packets sent by the
                host, for the IN data stage.
           5.  Once the firmware is ready, and has successfully prepared the
                data to be sent to the host in fulfillment of the control
                transfer, it should then call USBEP0SendRAMPtr() or
                USBEP0SendROMPtr(), to prepare the USB stack to know how many
                bytes to send to the host, and from what source location.
           6.  The firmware should now call USBCtrlEPAllowDataStage().  This
                will allow the data stage to complete.  The USB stack will send
                the data buffer specified by the USBEP0SendRAMPtr() or 
                USBEP0SendROMPtr() function, when it was called.
           7.  Once all data has been sent to the host, or if the host performs
                early termination, the status stage (a 0-byte OUT packet) will
                complete automatically (assuming the firmware did not call
                USBDeferStatusStage() during step #3).
            
     
  Description:
    
  Conditions: Before calling USBDeferINDataStage(), the firmware should first
                verify that the control transfer has a data stage, and that
                it is of type device-to-host (IN).

  Input:

  Return:

  Remarks: Section 9.2.6 of the official USB 2.0 specifications indicates that
            the USB device must return the first IN data packet within 500ms
            of the start of the control transfer.  In order to meet this
            specification, the firmware must call USBEP0SendRAMPtr() or
            USBEP0SendROMPtr(), and then call USBCtrlEPAllowDataStage(), in
            less than 500ms from the start of the control transfer.    
            
           If the firmware calls USBDeferINDataStage(), it must eventually call
           USBEP0SendRAMPtr() or USBEP0SendROMPtr(), and then call 
           USBCtrlEPAllowDataStage().  If it does not do this, the control
           transfer will never be able to complete.
           
           The firmware should never call both USBDeferINDataStage() and 
           USBDeferOUTDataStage() during the same control transfer.  These 
           functions are mutually exclusive (a control transfer with data stage
           can never contain both IN and OUT data packets during the data stage).

  Summary: Returns TRUE if a control transfer with IN data stage is pending,

           This function (macro) would typically be used in the case where the
           USBDeviceTasks() function executes in the interrupt context (ex:
           USB_INTERRUPT option selected in usb_config.h), but the firmware
           wishes to take care of handling the data stage of the control transfer
           in the main loop context.  
           
           In this scenario, typical usage would be:
           1.  Host starts a control transfer with IN data stage.
           2.  USBDeviceTasks() (in this scenario, interrupt context) executes.
           3.  USBDeviceTasks() calls USBCBCheckOtherReq(), which in turn
                determines that the control transfer is class specific, with
                IN data stage.
           4.  The user code in USBCBCheckOtherReq() (also in interrupt context,
                since it is called from USBDeviceTasks(), and therefore executes
                at the same priority/context) calls USBDeferINDataStage().

  Description:
    This function indicates if remote wakeup has been enabled by the host.
    Devices that support remote wakeup should use this function to
    determine if it should send a remote wakeup.
    
    If a device does not support remote wakeup (the Remote wakeup bit, bit
    5, of the bmAttributes field of the Configuration descriptor is set to
    1), then it should not send a remote wakeup command to the PC and this
    function is not of any use to the device. If a device does support
    remote wakeup then it should use this function as described below.
    
    If this function returns FALSE and the device is suspended, it should
    not issue a remote wakeup (resume).
    
    If this function returns TRUE and the device is suspended, it should
    issue a remote wakeup (resume).
    
    A device can add remote wakeup support by having the _RWU symbol added
    in the configuration descriptor (located in the usb_descriptors.c file
    in the project). This done in the 8th byte of the configuration
    descriptor. For example:

    <code lang="c">
    ROM BYTE configDescriptor1[]={
        0x09,                           // Size 
        USB_DESCRIPTOR_CONFIGURATION,   // descriptor type 
        DESC_CONFIG_WORD(0x0022),       // Total length 
        1,                              // Number of interfaces 
        1,                              // Index value of this cfg 
        0,                              // Configuration string index

        USB_HANDLE USBGetNextHandle(BYTE ep_num, BYTE ep_dir)
    Summary:
        Retrieves the handle to the next endpoint BDT entry that the 
        USBTransferOnePacket() will use.
    Description:
        Retrieves the handle to the next endpoint BDT that the 
        USBTransferOnePacket() will use.  Useful for initialization and when
        ping pong buffering will be used on application endpoints.
    PreCondition:
        Will return NULL if the USB device has not yet been configured/the 
        endpoint specified has not yet been initalized by USBEnableEndpoint().
    Parameters:
        BYTE ep_num - The endpoint number to get the handle for (valid 
            values are 1-15,  0 is not a valid input value for this API)
        BYTE ep_dir - The endpoint direction associated with the endpoint number 
            to get the handle for (valid values are OUT_FROM_HOST and IN_TO_HOST).
    Return Values:
        USB_HANDLE - Returns the USB_HANDLE (a pointer) to the BDT that will be
            used next time the USBTransferOnePacket() function is called, for the
            given ep_num and ep_dir
    Remarks:
        This API is useful for initializing USB_HANDLEs during initialization of
        the application firmware.  It is also useful when ping-pong bufferring is
        enabled, and the application firmware wishes to arm both the even and odd
        BDTs for an endpoint simultaneously.  In this case, the application 
        firmware for sending data to the host would typically be something like 
        follows:
        
        <code lang="c">
        USB_HANDLE Handle1;
        USB_HANDLE Handle2;

        BYTE* pDataBuffer = &UserDataBuffer1[0];
        
        //Add some code that loads UserDataBuffer1[] with useful data to send, 
        //using the pDataBuffer pointer, for example:

        if(!USBHandleBusy(USBGetNextHandle(ep_num, IN_TO_HOST))
        {
            //The endpoint is available.  Send the data.
            *pHandle = USBTransferOnePacket(ep_num, ep_dir, pDataBuffer, bytecount);
            //Toggle the handle and buffer pointer for the next transaction
            if(pHandle == &Handle1)

            }
        }
        
        //The firmware can then load the next data buffer (in this case 
        //UserDataBuffer2)with useful data, and send it using the same 
        //process.  For example:
