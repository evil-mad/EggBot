    \function driver.  This file should also be included into the 
    usb_descriptors.c file and any other user file that requires access to the

  Description:
    USB CDC Function Driver File
    
    This file contains all of functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for usage with the CDC function
    driver. This file should be included in projects that use the CDC
    \function driver.  This file should also be included into the 
    usb_descriptors.c file and any other user file that requires access to the
    CDC interface.
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    .
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

 Change History:
  Rev    Description
  ----   -----------
  2.3    Decricated the mUSBUSARTIsTxTrfReady() macro.  It is 
         replaced by the USBUSARTIsTxTrfReady() function.

  2.6    Minor definition changes

  2.6a   No Changes
  
  2.9b   Added new CDCNotificationHandler() prototype and related 
         structure definitions useful when sending serial state
         notifications over the CDC interrupt endpoint.

    Description:
        This macro is used to check if the CDC class handler firmware is 
        ready to send more data to the host over the CDC bulk IN endpoint.

        Typical Usage:

        The return value of this function is only valid if the device is in a
        configured state (i.e. - USBDeviceGetState() returns CONFIGURED_STATE)
        
    Parameters:
        None
        
    Return Values:
        Returns a boolean value indicating if the CDC class handler firmware
        is ready to receive new data to send to the host over the bulk data IN
        endpoint.  A return value of true indicates that the CDC handler 
        firmware is ready to receive new data, and it is therefore safe to
        call other APIs like putrsUSBUSART() and putsUSBUSART().  A return
        value of false implies that the firmware is still busy sending the
        last data, or is otherwise not ready to process any new data at
        this time.
        
    Remarks:
        Make sure the application periodically calls the CDCTxService()
        handler, or pending USB IN transfers will not be able to advance
        and complete.

        Unlike putrsUSBUSART, there is not code double checking
        the transfer state. Unexpected behavior will occur if
        this function is called when cdc_trf_state != CDC_TX_READY
 
          Typical Usage:
        <code>
            if(USBUSARTIsTxTrfReady())
            {
                mUSBUSARTTxRom(&SomeRomString[0], 200);
            }
        </code>
       
    PreCondition:
        cdc_trf_state must be in the CDC_TX_READY state.
        Value of 'len' must be equal to or smaller than 255 bytes.
        
    Parameters:
        pDdata  : Pointer to the starting location of data bytes
        len     : Number of bytes to be transferred
        
    Return Values:
        None
        
    Remarks:
        This macro only handles the setup of the transfer. The
        actual transfer is handled by CDCTxService().

  Summary:
    This function initializes the CDC function driver. This function should
    be called after the SET_CONFIGURATION command (ex: within the context of
    the USBCBInitEP() function).
  Description:
    This function initializes the CDC function driver. This function sets
    the default line coding (baud rate, bit parity, number of data bits,
    and format). This function also enables the endpoints and prepares for
    the first transfer from the host.
    
    This function should be called after the SET_CONFIGURATION command.
    This is most simply done by calling this function from the
