Ideas for EBB v3.0.0 firmware tests

1 Command Tests

  1.1 Test command responses

    * Start with default power on state
    * Execute each command
    * Confirm that proper response is sent by each command
    * Switch to new response mode
    * Execute each command
    * Confirm that the proper response is sent by each command
  
  
2 Move Command Tests

  2.1 Test step counts

    * For each of the types of move commands:
      * Create a series of moves
      * Record the beginning and ending global positions, confirm it is correct
      * Use Saleae to record each set of moves
        * Analyze step and direction pulses
        * Confirm that proper number of steps in each direction were taken
      
      
  2.2 Test step rates (speed of steps pulses correct?)
  
    * For each of the types of move commands:
      * Create a series of moves with space between them
      * Run the moves, capture the output using Saleae
      * Confirm that step rates at beginning, middle, and end of each move are within acceptable tolerance
      
  2.3 Test move command rates (how fast can various move commands be processed/executed?)
  
    * For each of the types of move commands:
      * Starting with longer moves and getting shorter
        * Execute a string of move commands back to back
        * Measure how many commands per second
        * Find out where gaps begin
