/*
 * This module implements the RC Servo outputs, method 2
 * 
 * Started by Brian Schmalz (www.schmalzhaus.com) on 8/22/09
 * For the Egg Bot Firmware
 *
 * There are several paarts of this file. It is written in a modular
 * way to ease incorporation into different UBW (www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW) 
 * hardware builds. Because we don't want to have any function calls in the ISR,
 * the part of the ISR that this module contributes is implemented as a big
 * macro. There is a section for the API calls (for other modules) to turn
 * on/off RC method 2 and to set values and configure outputs. Then there is the
 * user command section that handles parsing user input. This module (the .c and
 * .h files) should be able to be dropped into any UBW firmware that is 'module
 * aware' with minimial changes. There is also an init section that gets called
 * on bootup.
 *
 * MODULE THEORY
 *
 * The idea is that we want to generate between zero and eight RC servo outputs. 
 * We want a maximum of resolution in their timing, and a minimum of CPU and ISR
 * overhead. We want maximum flexibility with respect to which pins receive the
 * output pulses. This 'method 2' only works with PICs that have the PPS
 * (Perhipheral Pin Select) hardware. Using this method, we will be able to
 * generate servo output pulses (positive going) on up to eight output pins
 * (selectable using PPS), with times from 0ms to 3ms, at a repitition rate of
 * 24ms. The resolution of the pulse will be 83ns (Fosc/4). So a value of 0 will
 * represent 0ms pulse, and 36000 will represent 3ms.
 *
 * On UBW firmware, TIMER1 generates an interrupt every 1ms. This interrupt is 
 * used to schedule the four RC servo outputs. Every 3 fires of this ISR, we
 * check to see if we need to set the next RC output pin. If so, we select the
 * proper pin using the PPS, set it high, record what state we are now in, and
 * then set up TMR3 and ECCP2 to fire after X 83ns ticks of TMR3. ECCP2 will
 * wait until TMR3 fires, then will set the output pin low. This method allows
 * us to choose any of the PPS pins as outputs, and only requires CPU time every
 * 3 ms to start off the pulses.
 *
 * As of version 2.2.0, we have changed the way that the S2 command works.
 * Under the hood, ALL servo commands are now handled by the motion engine
 * ISR. This means that the S2 command now simply fills in a data structure
 * and puts it in the motion queue. The motion engine ISR pulls it off the
 * queue and then 'executes' the command. (All it does there is transfer the
 * proper values to the data structures that the actual RC servo ISR uses to
 * update the various output pins for each servo pulse.) But the key here is
 * that the S2 command no longer takes effect immediatly - RC servo commands
 * are now handleded in the same way that SM commands are handled. Which means
 * they can be queued up and delays added, etc.
 *
 * The other effect of this change is that the normal SP pen up/pen down
 * commands are now just normal S2 commands in disguise.

/*
The idea with RCServo2 is to use the ECCP2 module and timer 3.
We divide time into 24ms periods. Inside each 24ms period, we
can fire up to 8 RC servo's pulses (slots). Each pulse can be between
0ms and 3ms long, controlled entirely by the ECCP2 hardware,
so there is no jitter in the high time of the pulse.

We want to go from 0ms to 3ms so we can accomodate RC servos
who need really short or really long pulses to reach the
physical extremes of its motion.

This RCServo2 method will only be available on the 18F45J50 based
EggBotBoards, because it requires the PPS (peripheral pin select)
facility to be possible.

Timer3 will be configured to clock at Fosc/4 = 12MHz.
At this rate, a 1ms high pulse would need a CCPR2 value of 12,000.

Variables:

gRC2msCounter - counts from 0 to 2, in ms, to know when to fire each servo
gRC2Ptr - index into gRC2Value and gRC2Pin arrays = next RC servo to fire
gRC2Value - uint array of values (times) to load into Timer3
gRC2Pin - what PPS pin is affected by this RC servo slot.
gRC2RPORPtr - a RAM pointer into the RPORxx register

If a slot's gRC2Value[] = 0, then that slot is disabled and its pin will be low.
The value in gRC2Pin is the PPS RPx pin number that this slot controls
