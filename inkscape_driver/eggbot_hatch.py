#
# Generate hatch fills for the closed paths (polygons) in the currently
# selected document elements.  If no elements are selected, then all the
# polygons throughout the document are hatched.  The fill rule is an odd/even
# rule: odd numbered intersections (1, 3, 5, etc.) are a hatch line entering
# a polygon while even numbered intersections (2, 4, 6, etc.) are the same
# hatch line exiting the polygon.
#
# This extension first decomposes the selected <path>, <rect>, <line>,
# <polyline>, <polygon>, <circle>, and <ellipse> elements into individual
# moveto and lineto coordinates using the same procedure that eggbot.py uses
# for plotting.  These coordinates are then used to build vertex lists.
# Only the vertex lists corresponding to polygons (closed paths) are
# kept.  Note that a single graphical element may be composed of several
# subpaths, each subpath potentially a polygon.
#
# Once the lists of all the vertices are built, potential hatch lines are
# "projected" through the bounding box containing all of the vertices.
# For each potential hatch line, all intersections with all the polygon
# edges are determined.  These intersections are stored as decimal fractions
# indicating where along the length of the hatch line the intersection
# occurs.  These values will always be in the range [0, 1].  A value of 0
# indicates that the intersection is at the start of the hatch line, a value
# of 0.5 midway, and a value of 1 at the end of the hatch line.
#
# For a given hatch line, all the fractional values are sorted and any
# duplicates removed.  Duplicates occur, for instance, when the hatch
# line passes through a polygon vertex and thus intersects two edges
# segments of the polygon: the end of one edge and the start of
# another.
#
# Once sorted and duplicates removed, an odd/even rule is applied to
# determine which segments of the potential hatch line are within
# polygons.  These segments found to be within polygons are then saved
# and become the hatch fill lines which will be drawn.
#
# With each saved hatch fill line, information about which SVG graphical
# element it is within is saved.  This way, the hatch fill lines can
# later be grouped with the element they are associated with.  This makes
# it possible to manipulate the two -- graphical element and hatch lines --
# as a single object within Inkscape.
#
# Note: we also save the transformation matrix for each graphical element.
# That way, when we group the hatch fills with the element they are
# filling, we can invert the transformation.  That is, in order to compute
# the hatch fills, we first have had apply ALL applicable transforms to
# all the graphical elements.  We need to do that so that we know where in
# the drawing  each of the graphical elements are relative to one another.
# However, this means that the hatch lines have been computed in a setting
# where no further transforms are needed.  If we then put these hatch lines
# into the same groups as the elements being hatched in the ORIGINAL
# drawing, then the hatch lines will have transforms applied again.  So,
# once we compute the hatch lines, we need to invert the transforms of
# the group they will be placed in and apply this inverse transform to the
# hatch lines.  Hence the need to save the transform matrix for every
# graphical element.

Geometry 101: Determining if two lines intersect

A line L is defined by two points in space P1 and P2.  Any point P on the
line L satisfies

    P = P1 + s (P2 - P1)

for some value of the real number s in the range (-infinity, infinity).
If we confine s to the range [0, 1] then we've described the line segment
with end points P1 and P2.

Consider now the line La defined by the points P1 and P2, and the line Lb
defined by the points P3 and P4.  Any points Pa and Pb on the lines La and
Lb therefore satisfy

    Pa = P1 + sa (P2 - P1)
    Pb = P3 + sb (P4 - P3)

for some values of the real numbers sa and sb.  To see if these two lines
La and Lb intersect, we wish to see if there are finite values sa and sb
for which

    Pa = Pb

Or, equivalently, we ask if there exists values of sa and sb for which
the equation

    P1 + sa (P2 - P1) = P3 + sb (P4 - P3)

holds.  If we confine ourselves to a two-dimensional plane, and take

    P1 = (x1, y1)
    P2 = (x2, y2)
    P3 = (x3, y3)
    P4 = (x4, y4)

we then find that we have two equations in two unknowns, sa and sb,

    x1 + sa ( x2 - x1 ) = x3 + sb ( x4 - x3 )
    y1 + sa ( y2 - y1 ) = y3 + sb ( y4 - y3 )

Solving these two equations for sa and sb yields,

    sa = [ ( y1 - y3 ) ( x4 - x3 ) - ( y4 - y3 ) ( x1 - x3 ) ] / d
    sb = [ ( y1 - y3 ) ( x2 - x1 ) - ( y2 - y1 ) ( x1 - x3 ) ] / d

where the denominator, d, is given by

    d = ( y4 - y3 ) ( x2 - x1 ) - ( y2 - y1 ) ( x4 - x3 )

Substituting these back for the point (x, y) of intersection gives

    x = x1 + sa ( x2 - x1 )
    y = y1 + sa ( y2 - y1 )

Note that

1. The lines are parallel when d = 0
2. The lines are coincident d = 0 and the numerators for sa & sb are zero
3. For line segments, sa and sb are in the range [0, 1]; any value outside
   that range indicates that the line segments do not intersect.

    When an intersection of the line L is found with a polygon edge, then

    fractional distance is always in the range [0, 1].

    Once all polygons have been checked, the list of fractional distances
    corresponding to intersections is sorted and any duplicates removed.
    It is then assumed that the first intersection is the line L entering
    a polygon; the second intersection the line leaving the polygon.  This
    line segment defined by the first and second intersection points is
    thus a hatch fill line we sought to generate.  In general, our hatch
    fills become the line segments described by intersection i and i+1
    with i an odd value (1, 3, 5, ...).  Since we know the lxml.etree node
    corresponding to each intersection, we can then correlate the hatch
    fill lines to the graphical elements in the original SVG document.
